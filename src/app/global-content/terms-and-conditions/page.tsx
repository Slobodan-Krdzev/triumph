          The photos and videos used on our Sites feature Triumph motorcycles
          used by qualified professional riders in protective gear, under
          professionally controlled conditions in areas closed to traffic. We do
          not recommend or encourage dangerous maneuvers, stunts or any form of
          reckless driving. The Motorcycles featured in our videos are street
          legal models with some light off road capabilities. Light off-road use
          includes use on unpaved, dirt or gravel roads, but does not include
          riding on a motocross track, any off-road competition, or off-road
          riding with a second rider in the saddle. Light off-road use does not
          involve jumping the motorcycles or riding over obstacles. The
          maneuvers or stunt driving shown in our photos and videos should not
          be attempted at home. At Triumph we want every ride to be safe and
          enjoyable. Always drive safely, defensively and within the limits of
          the law. Always drive within your capabilities, take driving skills
          lessons and wear protective equipment. Never drive under the influence
          of alcohol or drugs. Always wear an approved helmet, eye protection
          and suitable protective clothing and always insist on the same for the
          passenger. Study the owner s manual and inspect your Triumph
          motorcycle before riding. Our Application can be used to provide you
          with directions on your route. In the event that you wish to use this
          feature of our App, you must not use our App or the My Triumph
          Connectivity System in a manner that may distract you while driving.
          You must not use any other feature of our App, or use our App for any
          other purpose, while driving. You should never use our Website while
